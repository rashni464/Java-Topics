Step 1: create a new package  below to main-java-com by right click and give name as controller.
step 2: write the required code in it.
@RestController:  @RESTController is a spring boot annotation that informs our application that our HelloWorldController class will be exposing REST endpoints. This will help us create RESTful web services.

Similarly, the @GetMapping annotation is used to handle HTTP GET requests. GET requests are used to retrieve sources. The “/hello-world” is the URI needed to gain access to the source.


code starts from here--------

import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.GetMapping;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.RestController;

@RestController
public class HelloWorldController {
    @GetMapping("/hello-world")
    public String HelloWorld(){
        return "hello world";
    }
}
